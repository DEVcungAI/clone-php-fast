```

This directory structure provides a clear overview of where different types of files and functionalities are located in the PHP-Fast framework.

## 4. Configuration

PHP-Fast uses a simple and flexible configuration system. The main configuration file is located in the `application/config/config.php`. This file contains various settings for your application, including app settings, database, email, caching, and themes.

### Basic Configuration

Here is a breakdown of the key configuration options available in `config.php`:

#### Application Settings
- `debug`: Set to `true` for development, `false` for production.
- `environment`: Specify the application environment (`development`, `production`, etc.).
- `app_url`: The base URL of your application.
- `app_name`: The name of your application.
- `app_timezone`: Set the timezone for your application.

```php
'app' => [
    'debug' => true,
    'environment' => 'development',
    'app_url' => 'https://phpfast.net/code/',
    'app_name' => 'phpfast',
    'app_timezone' => 'UTC'
]
```

#### Security Settings
- `app_id`: A unique identifier for your application.
- `app_secret`: A secret key for securing your application.

#### Database Configuration
- `db_driver`: Database driver to use (mysql, pgsql, etc.).
- `db_host`, `db_port`: Hostname and port for the database server.
- `db_username`, `db_password`: Credentials for connecting to the database.
- `db_database`: The name of the database.
- `db_charset`: Character set for database communication.

#### Cache Settings
- `cache_driver`: Cache driver to use (redis, file, etc.).
- `cache_host`, `cache_port`: Host and port for the cache server.
- `cache_username`, `cache_password`: Credentials for the cache server (if required).
- `cache_database`: Cache database index (used in Redis).

#### Theme Settings
- `theme_path`: Path to the theme directory.
- `theme_name`: Name of the active theme.

### Modifying Configuration
To change these settings, open `application/config/config.php` and update the corresponding values based on your environment and requirements.

## 5. Command-Line

PHP-Fast includes a built-in command-line interface (CLI) to simplify the creation of controllers, models, and database synchronization. The CLI tool allows you to quickly scaffold various components of your application and perform essential tasks without manual coding.

### Usage

To use the command-line interface, open your terminal, navigate to the root directory of your project, and run:

php init <command> <name>

### 1. Database Synchronization (table)
Synchronizes the database table based on the model's schema. This command reads the schema defined in the model's _schema() method and applies the changes to the database.
Command: `php init table <name>`

### 2. Create Controller (controllers)
Generates a new controller file in the application/controllers directory. The command creates a basic controller template, helping you quickly set up new features for your application.
Command: `php init controllers <name>`

### 3. Create Model (models)
Creates a new model file in the application/models directory. The command provides a default model template, including the _schema() method for defining the database table's structure and CRUD functions.
Command: `php init models <name>`

## 6. Routing

PHP-Fast provides a flexible routing system that maps HTTP requests to specific controllers and methods within your application. Routing definitions are located in the `application/routes` directory and are typically separated into files such as `web.php` for web routes and `api.php` for API routes.

### Defining Routes

Routes in PHP-Fast are defined using the `$routes` object in the respective route files. The syntax for defining routes is simple and allows for various HTTP methods such as `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`, etc.

### Basic Routing in `web.php`

### Supported Parameter Types and Regular Expression Conversion

The `convertToRegex` function in PHP-Fast supports various parameter types in routes, similar to CodeIgniter. These parameters are converted into regular expressions to match segments in the URL. Below are the supported parameter types and their corresponding regex patterns:

- `(:any)`: Matches any characters except for a forward slash (`/`). Converts to `(.+)`.
- `(:segment)`: Matches any segment of the URL, excluding slashes. Converts to `([^/]+)`.
- `(:num)`: Matches only numeric values. Converts to `(\d+)`.
- `(:alpha)`: Matches alphabetic characters (both uppercase and lowercase). Converts to `([a-zA-Z]+)`.
- `(:alphadash)`: Matches alphabetic characters and dashes (`-`). Converts to `([a-zA-Z\-]+)`.
- `(:alphanum)`: Matches alphanumeric characters. Converts to `([a-zA-Z0-9]+)`.
- `(:alphanumdash)`: Matches alphanumeric characters and dashes (`-`). Converts to `([a-zA-Z0-9\-]+)`.

Here is how these parameters can be used in route definitions and how they are processed by the `convertToRegex` function:

### Examples

```php

// Routes with Method: GET/POST/PUT/DELETE
$routes->get('user/(:num)', 'UsersController::view:$1');
$routes->post('user/create', 'UsersController::create');
$routes->put('user/edit/(:num)', 'UsersController::edit:$1');
$routes->delete('user/delete/(:num)', 'UsersController::delete:$1');

// Matches any URL with a single segment (any characters)
$routes->get('blog/(:any)', 'BlogController::show:$1');
// Example URL: blog/my-awesome-post
// Converted to regex: #^blog/(.+)$#

// Matches a URL segment with any characters except slashes
$routes->get('category/(:segment)', 'CategoryController::list:$1');
// Example URL: category/electronics
// Converted to regex: #^category/([^/]+)$#

// Matches a URL segment with Action Function Rounter
$routes->get('news/(:any)', 'CategoryController::$1');
// Example URL: news/index => call to NewsController()->index(); news/home => call to NewsController()->home()

// Matches a numeric segment
$routes->get('product/(:num)', 'ProductController::details:$1');
// Example URL: product/123
// Converted to regex: #^product/(\d+)$#

// Matches a URL segment containing only alphabetic characters
$routes->get('user/(:alpha)', 'UserController::profile:$1');
// Example URL: user/johndoe
// Converted to regex: #^user/([a-zA-Z]+)$#

// Matches a URL segment containing alphabetic characters and dashes
$routes->get('slug/(:alphadash)', 'PageController::show:$1');
// Example URL: slug/welcome-to-phpfast
// Converted to regex: #^slug/([a-zA-Z\-]+)$#

// Matches a URL segment containing alphanumeric characters
$routes->get('code/(:alphanum)', 'CodeController::execute:$1');
// Example URL: code/abc123
// Converted to regex: #^code/([a-zA-Z0-9]+)$#

// Matches a URL segment containing alphanumeric characters and dashes
$routes->get('article/(:alphanumdash)', 'ArticleController::read:$1');
// Example URL: article/phpfast-101
// Converted to regex: #^article/([a-zA-Z0-9\-]+)$#

//Middleware in Routes
You can apply middleware to routes to handle specific logic before a request reaches the controller. Here's an example of applying middleware:

// Applying middleware to a single route
$routes->get('admin', 'AdminController::index', [\App\Middlewares\AuthMiddleware::class]);

// Applying middleware to multiple routes
$routes->group('admin', function($routes) {
    $routes->get('dashboard', 'AdminController::dashboard');
    $routes->post('settings', 'AdminController::saveSettings');
}, [\App\Middlewares\AuthMiddleware::class]);

```

## 7. Creating a Controller

Controllers in PHP-Fast are responsible for handling HTTP requests and returning responses. They act as a bridge between models, views, and other application components. All controllers are stored in the `application/controllers` directory.

### Creating a New Controller

To create a new controller manually, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the `application/controllers` directory.
2. Create a new file with the name of your controller, e.g., `ProductsController.php`.
3. Define the controller class by extending `System\Core\BaseController`.

Here is a basic example:

```php
<?php

namespace App\Controllers;

use System\Core\BaseController;

class ProductsController extends BaseController
{
    public function index()
    {
        // Code to fetch and display a list of products
        echo "Welcome to the Products Page!";
    }

    public function show($id)
    {
        // Code to fetch and display a single product by ID
        echo "Product ID: " . $id;
    }
}
```

### Using the Command-Line Interface
You can also use the built-in command-line tool to create a new controller:
```bash
php init controllers <controller-name>
```
Example:
php init controllers Welcome

This will create a `ProductsController.php` file in the `application/controllers` directory with a basic structure.

#### Basic Structure of a Controller
A controller in PHP-Fast typically consists of several methods, each corresponding to a specific action or HTTP request (e.g., viewing a list, creating a new item, updating, or deleting). Here's an example structure:

```php
<?php

namespace App\Controllers;

use System\Core\BaseController;

class UsersController extends BaseController
{
    public function index()
    {
        // This method handles displaying the list of users
    }

    public function create()
    {
        // This method handles displaying a form for creating a new user
    }

    public function store()
    {
        // This method handles storing the new user data
    }

    public function edit($id)
    {
        // This method handles displaying a form for editing an existing user
    }

    public function update($id)
    {
        // This method handles updating an existing user
    }

    public function delete($id)
    {
        // This method handles deleting a user
    }
}
```

#### Routing to a Controller
To route HTTP requests to a controller, define your routes in application/routes/web.php or application/routes/api.php. Here is an example:

```php
$routes->get('products', 'ProductsController::index');
$routes->get('products/(:num)', 'ProductsController::show:$1');
```

In the above example:
```php
ProductsController::index is called when the /products URL is accessed.
ProductsController::show:$1 is called when /products/{id} is accessed, where {id} is a dynamic parameter.
```

### Using Middleware in a Controller
Controllers can also use middleware to handle tasks like authentication and permission checks. Here's how to apply middleware in a controller:
```php
$routes->get('admin/products', 'ProductsController::index', [\App\Middlewares\AuthMiddleware::class]);
```

### Accessing Models in a Controller
Controllers can access models to interact with the database. Here's an example of loading a model and using it in a controller:

```php
<?php

namespace App\Controllers;

use System\Core\BaseController;
use App\Models\ProductsModel;

class ProductsController extends BaseController
{
    protected $productsModel;

    public function __construct()
    {
        $this->productsModel = new ProductsModel();
    }

    public function index()
    {
        $products = $this->productsModel->getAllProducts();
        // Pass the products to a view
        $this->render('products/index', ['products' => $products]);
    }
}
```

### Render Views & Assest Data to Views
```php
$this->data('title', 'Đây Là Trang Chủ');
$this->data('users', $users['data']);
$header = Render::component('component/header', ['title' => $this->data('title')]);
$footer = Render::component('component/footer');
$this->data('header', $header);
$this->data('footer', $footer);
echo $this->render('themes', 'home/home');
```

## 8. Creating a Model

Models in PHP-Fast are responsible for interacting with the database. They contain methods for querying, inserting, updating, and deleting data in the database. PHP-Fast provides a base model (`BaseModel`) that your models can extend to use common database operations easily.

### Using Command to Create Models

To quickly generate a new model, you can use the command-line tool:

```bash
php init models <model-name>

This command will create a new model file in the application/models directory.
```bash
php init models users
```

### Example of a Model

Below is an example of a model in PHP-Fast. This model (UsersModel) defines a table schema and includes basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

```php
<?php
namespace App\Models;
use System\Core\BaseModel;

class UsersModel extends BaseModel {

    protected $table = 'users';

    // Columns that are allowed to be added or updated
    protected $fillable = ['name', 'email', 'password', 'age'];

    // Columns that are protected and not allowed to be updated
    protected $guarded = ['id', 'created_at'];

    /**
     * Define the table schema using the schema builder
     * 
     * @return array Table schema
     */
    public function _schema() {
        return [
            'id' => [
                'type' => 'int unsigned',
                'auto_increment' => true,
                'key' => 'primary',
                'null' => false
            ],
            'name' => [
                'type' => 'varchar(150)',
                'key' => 'unique',
                'null' => false,
                'default' => ''
            ],
            'email' => [
                'type' => 'varchar(150)',
                'key'   =>  'unique',
                'null' => false,
                'default' => ''
            ],
            'password' => [
                'type' => 'varchar(100)',
                'null' => true,
                'default' => '1234567890123456789012345678932'
            ],
            'age' => [
                'type' => 'int',
                'key'   =>  'unique',
                'unsigned' => true,
                'null' => true,
                'default' => '18'
            ],
            'created_at' => [
                'type' => 'timestamp',
                'null' => true,
                'default' => '2020-01-01 01:01:01',
                'on_update' => 'CURRENT_TIMESTAMP'
            ],
            'updated_at' => [
                'type' => 'timestamp',
                'null' => true,
                'default' => '2020-01-01 01:01:01',

            ]
        ];
    }

    public function getUsers($where = '', $params = [], $orderBy = 'id DESC', $limit = null, $offset = null) {
        return $this->list($this->table, $where, $params, $orderBy, $limit, $offset);
    }
}
```

### Synchronizing Model into Database
After creating or modifying a model's schema, you can use the following command to synchronize the model's schema with the database:

```bash
php init table <model-name>
```

This command reads the schema defined in the model's _schema() method and synchronizes it with the database. Example:
```bash
php init table users
```

This will use the schema defined in UsersModel to create or update the users table in the database.

### Important Notes
The fillable property defines which columns can be mass-assigned, while the guarded property lists columns that should not be modified directly.
The _schema() method in the model defines the structure of the table and is used for database synchronization.
Use the built-in methods in BaseModel (e.g., list, row, add, set, del) to simplify database operations in your models.

## 9. Creating Middleware

Middleware in PHP-Fast allows you to filter HTTP requests entering your application. This can be useful for tasks such as user authentication, input validation, and permission checks before the request reaches the controller.

### Creating a Middleware

To create a new middleware, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the `application/middlewares` directory.
2. Create a new file, for example, `AuthMiddleware.php`.
3. Define your middleware logic in the new file. Here's an example of a basic authentication middleware:

```php
<?php

namespace App\Middlewares;

class AuthMiddleware {
    public function handle($request, $next) {
        // Authentication logic
        if (!isset($_SESSION['user'])) {
            echo "Unauthorized access!";
            exit;
        }
        return $next($request);
    }
}
```

## 9. Creating Middleware

Middleware in PHP-Fast provides a convenient mechanism for filtering HTTP requests entering your application. You can use middleware for various tasks, such as verifying if a user is authenticated, logging requests, or managing permissions. This section will guide you through the creation and usage of middleware in PHP-Fast.

### Adding Middleware

All middleware classes should be placed in the `application/middlewares` directory. A middleware class contains a `handle` method, which will be executed when the middleware is applied to a route or controller.

### Example: Creating an Authentication Middleware

Let's create a simple `AuthMiddleware` that checks if a user is logged in before allowing access to certain routes.

1. Navigate to `application/middlewares/` and create a new file named `AuthMiddleware.php`.

2. Add the following code to `AuthMiddleware.php`:

    ```php
    <?php
    namespace App\Middlewares;

    class AuthMiddleware {
        public function handle($request, $next) {
            // Authentication logic
            if (!isset($_SESSION['user'])) {
                echo "Unauthorized access!";
                exit;
            }
            return $next($request);
        }
    }
    ```

### Applying Middleware to Routes

To apply middleware to a route, pass the middleware class name as an array in the route definition within `application/routes/web.php` or `application/routes/api.php`.

Example: Applying `AuthMiddleware` to a route in `web.php`:

    ```php
    $routes->get('admin', 'AdminController::index', [\App\Middlewares\AuthMiddleware::class]);
    ```

In this example, when the user accesses the `admin` route, the `AuthMiddleware`'s `handle` method is executed before the `AdminController`'s `index` method.

### Creating a Permission Middleware

Similarly, you can create a `PermissionMiddleware` to manage access control for different parts of your application.

1. Create a new file in `application/middlewares/` named `PermissionMiddleware.php`.

2. Add the following code:

    ```php
    <?php
    namespace App\Middlewares;

    class PermissionMiddleware {
        public function handle($request, $next, $permissions = []) {
            // Check if the user has the required permissions
            $userPermissions = $_SESSION['user_permissions'] ?? [];

            foreach ($permissions as $permission) {
                if (!in_array($permission, $userPermissions)) {
                    echo "Access denied!";
                    exit;
                }
            }

            return $next($request);
        }
    }
    ```

3. Apply this middleware to a route and pass the necessary permissions:

    ```php
    $routes->get('admin/settings', 'AdminController::settings', [
        [\App\Middlewares\PermissionMiddleware::class, ['manage_settings']]
    ]);
    ```

### Using Middleware in Controllers

You can also use middleware in controllers to filter access to specific methods.

1. In your controller (e.g., `AdminController.php`), call the middleware within the method:

    ```php
    namespace App\Controllers;

    use System\Core\BaseController;
    use App\Middlewares\AuthMiddleware;

    class AdminController extends BaseController {
        public function index() {
            // Call the middleware
            (new AuthMiddleware())->handle(request(), function() {
                // Code for the index method
                echo "Welcome to the Admin Dashboard!";
            });
        }
    }
    ```

### Conclusion

Middleware provides a clean and reusable way to handle common tasks, such as authentication and permission checks, in your application. By creating and applying middleware to routes or within controllers, you can enforce consistent behavior and security across your web application.

## 10. Views and Templates

PHP-Fast provides a flexible view rendering system to help you create dynamic web pages. The views are stored in the `application/views/` directory and support layouts, components, and data passing.

### Directory Structure

By default, the views are organized as follows:

```php
application/ 
── views/ 
──────default/ 
────────admin/ 
────────component/ 
────────────footer.php 
────────────header.php
────────home/ 
────────────add_user.php 
────────────edit_user.php 
────────────home.php 
────────404.php
────────themes.php
```


### Creating a View

1. Navigate to the `application/views/` directory.
2. Create a new `.php` file in the desired directory (e.g., `home/home.php`).
3. Add your HTML and PHP content to the file:
    ```php
    <h1>Welcome to PHP-Fast</h1>
    <p>This is the home page.</p>
    ```

### Using Layouts

A layout is a common template file (e.g., `header`, `footer`) used to wrap around the main content of your pages. You can store layouts in the `component/` directory. 

- Example `header.php` (located at `application/views/default/component/header.php`):
    ```php
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
    <head>
        <title>PHP-Fast - <?= $pageTitle ?? 'Home' ?></title>
    </head>
    <body>
    <header>
        <h1>Header Component</h1>
    </header>
    ```

- Example `footer.php` (located at `application/views/default/component/footer.php`):
    ```php
    <footer>
        <p>&copy; 2024 PHP-Fast</p>
    </footer>
    </body>
    </html>
    ```

### Passing Data to Views

You can pass data from a controller to a view using the `Render` library. Use the `setData()` method to set the data and the `render()` method to render the view.

- Example Controller:
    ```php
    <?php

    namespace App\Controllers;

    use System\Core\BaseController;

    class HomeController extends BaseController {
        public function index() {
            $data = [
                'pageTitle' => 'Welcome to PHP-Fast',
                'message' => 'This is the home page.'
            ];
            
            // Set data and render view
            $this->setData($data);
            $this->render('home/home');
        }
    }
    ```

- Example View (`home/home.php`):
    ```php
    <h1><?= $pageTitle ?></h1>
    <p><?= $message ?></p>
    ```

### Rendering Components

Components are reusable parts of the view, like headers, footers, and sidebars. Use the `Render` library to include components in your views.

- Example (`home/home.php`):
    ```php
    <?php $this->render('component/header'); ?>
    
    <h1><?= $pageTitle ?></h1>
    <p><?= $message ?></p>
    
    <?php $this->render('component/footer'); ?>
    ```

### Example: Full Page Rendering

Here’s an example of a full page rendering using the `Render` library in a controller:

- Controller (`HomeController.php`):
    ```php
    <?php

    namespace App\Controllers;

    use System\Core\BaseController;

    class HomeController extends BaseController {
        public function index() {
            $data = [
                'pageTitle' => 'Welcome to PHP-Fast',
                'message' => 'This is the home page.'
            ];
            
            // Set data and render the full page with layout components
            $this->setData($data);
            $this->render('component/header');
            $this->render('home/home');
            $this->render('component/footer');
        }
    }
    ```

### Error Pages

Custom error pages can be created and placed in the `application/views/default/` directory. For example, a 404 error page can be defined in `404.php`.

- Example `404.php`:
    ```php
    <h1>404 - Page Not Found</h1>
    <p>The page you are looking for does not exist.</p>
    ```

You can then handle errors in your controller and render the error page when necessary:

- Example:
    ```php
    if (!$pageFound) {
        $this->render('404');
    }
    ```

### Conclusion

The view system in PHP-Fast allows you to build complex pages with ease. You can create layouts, include components, and pass data from controllers to views. This approach helps maintain a clean and modular codebase, making it easier to manage and extend your application.


## 11. Database Integration

PHP-Fast provides built-in support for integrating with databases. It includes a Database class and drivers to help you interact with your database using models and a query builder. The default configuration for the database is set in the `application/config/config.php` file, allowing you to easily manage different database connections.

### Using Models

Models are classes that allow you to interact with your database. Each model represents a table in your database and contains methods to query and manipulate data. By default, models are located in the `application/models` directory.

#### Creating a Model

You can create a new model manually or use the command-line tool to generate it:

**Manually:**
1. Navigate to `application/models`.
2. Create a new file, e.g., `UsersModel.php`.
3. Define the model class:

```php
<?php
namespace App\Models;

use System\Core\BaseModel;

class UsersModel extends BaseModel {
    protected $table = 'users';
    protected $fillable = ['username', 'email'];
    protected $guarded = ['id', 'created_at'];

    public function _schema() {
        return [
            'id' => ['type' => 'int unsigned', 'auto_increment' => true, 'key' => 'primary', 'null' => false],
            'username' => ['type' => 'varchar(100)', 'null' => false],
            'email' => ['type' => 'varchar(150)', 'null' => false]
        ];
    }

    // Additional methods for custom queries
}
```

#### Interacting with the Database

After creating your model, you can use it in your controllers to interact with the database.

**Example: Fetching all users:**

```php
<?php
use App\Models\UsersModel;

class UsersController extends BaseController {
    public function index() {
        $usersModel = new UsersModel();
        $users = $usersModel->getAll(); // Fetch all users
        $this->render('users/index', ['users' => $users]);
    }
}
```

### Query Builder

PHP-Fast includes a basic query builder to construct SQL queries programmatically. The query builder provides a fluent interface to perform database operations.

**Example: Basic Select Query:**

```php
$usersModel = new UsersModel();
$users = $usersModel->select('id, username')
                    ->where('status', 'active')
                    ->orderBy('created_at', 'DESC')
                    ->get();
```

**Example: Inserting Data:**

```php
$usersModel = new UsersModel();
$data = [
    'username' => 'john_doe',
    'email' => 'john@example.com'
];
$usersModel->insert($data);
```

### Database Drivers

PHP-Fast supports multiple database drivers. The available drivers are set up in the `system/drivers/database` directory. By default, the framework supports `MysqlDriver` and `PostgresqlDriver`.

#### Switching Database Drivers

To change the database driver, update the `db_driver` setting in `application/config/config.php`:

```php
'db' => [
    'db_driver' => 'postgresql', // Change to 'mysql' or 'postgresql'
    'db_host' => '127.0.0.1',
    'db_port' => 5432,
    'db_username' => 'postgres',
    'db_password' => '',
    'db_database' => 'phpfast',
    'db_charset'  => 'utf8'
],
```

The framework will automatically use the appropriate driver based on the configuration.

### Custom Queries

While the query builder is flexible for common use cases, you may need to run custom SQL queries in some scenarios. The model provides a method to execute raw queries:

**Example: Running a Raw Query:**

```php
$usersModel = new UsersModel();
$query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE status = :status";
$params = ['status' => 'active'];
$activeUsers = $usersModel->query($query, $params);
```

### Schema Management

The `_schema` method in your model defines the structure of the table associated with the model. You can use the command-line interface (`php init table <name>`) to synchronize your database tables with the defined schema.

**Example: Synchronizing a Table:**

Run the following command in your terminal to synchronize the table schema for the `UsersModel`:

```bash
php init table users
```

This command will use the `_schema` method in `UsersModel` to create or update the `users` table in your database.

### Notes
- Always define the `$table` property in your model to specify which table the model interacts with.
- Use `$fillable` to list the columns that can be mass-assigned during insert or update operations.
- Use `$guarded` to list the columns that should not be mass-assigned.

With these tools and methods, you can efficiently integrate your PHP-Fast application with various databases and perform robust data operations.


## 12. Caching

PHP-Fast provides a flexible caching system to help you optimize the performance of your application. The framework supports different caching drivers, allowing you to store cache data in various storage mechanisms like Redis, files, or others based on your requirements.

### Basic Usage

Caching can be utilized within controllers, models, or anywhere else in your application. The cache configuration is defined in `application/config/config.php` under the `'cache'` key.

#### Cache Configuration

In `application/config/config.php`, you can specify the cache driver and its associated settings:

```php
'cache' => [
    'cache_driver' => 'redis', // Choose between 'redis', 'file', etc.
    'cache_host' => '127.0.0.1',
    'cache_port' => 6379,
    'cache_username' => '',
    'cache_password' => '',
    'cache_database' => 0,
],
```

### Using Cache in Controllers

To use caching in your controllers, you can utilize the `Cache` class provided by the framework. The `Cache` class offers methods like `set()`, `get()`, and `delete()` to manage cache data.

#### Example: Setting Cache Data

```php
use System\Drivers\Cache\Cache;

class HomeController extends BaseController {
    public function index() {
        // Set cache data with a key and expiration time (in seconds)
        Cache::set('homepage_data', $data, 3600); // Caches $data for 1 hour
    }
}
```

#### Example: Retrieving Cache Data

```php
use System\Drivers\Cache\Cache;

class HomeController extends BaseController {
    public function index() {
        // Retrieve cache data using the key
        $data = Cache::get('homepage_data');

        if (!$data) {
            // If cache data doesn't exist, perform your logic and set it
            $data = $this->getFreshData();
            Cache::set('homepage_data', $data, 3600);
        }

        return $data;
    }
}
```

#### Example: Deleting Cache Data

```php
use System\Drivers\Cache\Cache;

class UserController extends BaseController {
    public function updateUser($id) {
        // Update user logic
        // ...

        // Clear cache for specific data
        Cache::delete('user_' . $id);
    }
}
```

### Cache Drivers

PHP-Fast's caching system supports multiple drivers. By default, the framework provides two drivers: `FilesCache` and `RedisCache`. You can implement additional drivers if needed by extending the `Cache` class.

#### File Cache

The `FilesCache` driver stores cache data as files on the server. This is a simple caching method that doesn't require any external services but may be slower for large-scale applications.

- To use the file cache, set the driver in `config.php`:

```php
'cache_driver' => 'file',
```

#### Redis Cache

The `RedisCache` driver uses a Redis server to store cache data, which provides fast, efficient, and persistent caching. It is suitable for larger applications and supports advanced cache operations.

- To use the Redis cache, set the driver in `config.php`:

```php
'cache_driver' => 'redis',
'cache_host' => '127.0.0.1',
'cache_port' => 6379,
'cache_database' => 0,
```

### Creating a Custom Cache Driver

If you want to implement a custom cache driver, you can create a new class in the `system/drivers/cache/` directory that extends the `Cache` class.

#### Example: Creating a Custom Cache Driver

1. Create a new file in the `system/drivers/cache/` directory, e.g., `CustomCache.php`.
2. Extend the `Cache` class and implement the required methods.

```php
namespace System\Drivers\Cache;

class CustomCache extends Cache {
    public function set($key, $value, $expiration = 0) {
        // Implement custom set logic
    }

    public function get($key) {
        // Implement custom get logic
    }

    public function delete($key) {
        // Implement custom delete logic
    }
}
```

3. Update the cache configuration in `config.php` to use your custom driver:

```php
'cache_driver' => 'custom',
```

### Notes
- Always choose a caching driver that best suits the scale and requirements of your application.
- Set appropriate expiration times for cached data to ensure data freshness and avoid stale cache issues.
- Use cache sparingly for data that is frequently accessed but does not change often.

By effectively using the caching system in PHP-Fast, you can significantly improve your application's performance and user experience.
